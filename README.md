# Stochastic Cross Alert MT4

Stochastic Cross Alert MT4 is a custom indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to provide buy and sell signals based on the crossing of the Stochastic indicator's main and signal lines.

## Indicator Settings

- **period**: The period used for calculating the Stochastic indicator. The default value is 14.
- **oversoldLevel**: The oversold level for the Stochastic indicator. The default value is 20.
- **overboughtLevel**: The overbought level for the Stochastic indicator. The default value is 80.

## How It Works

The Stochastic Cross Alert MT4 indicator uses the Stochastic indicator with the specified period, oversold level, and overbought level. It calculates the main and signal values for each bar and stores them in the MainBuffer and SignalBuffer arrays.

The indicator then checks for a cross above or below of the main and signal lines, as well as the previous bar's main value being below the oversold level or above the overbought level. If these conditions are met, a buy or sell signal is generated.

When a buy or sell signal is generated, an alert is triggered and a message is printed to the terminal.
